# EEE485_StatisticalLearningAndDataAnalysis

Author : Mehmet Berk Åžahin 

This is a term project of EEE 485 - Statistical Learning and Data Analytics course, which is given in Bilkent University. 
Three machine learning algorithms were implemented from scratch to predict the results of the soccer games correctly. These algorithms are Principal Component Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Feed-forward Neural Network. Python and NumPy were used in the design. 

Here are some useful material : 

1. You can find the report at Report.pdf. 
2. Source code is code.py. 
3. Dataset is compressed in data.zip. 

I suggest you to first read the report, then download the dataset and code and play with it. I hope this is useful for you. Enjoy!
