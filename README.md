Author : Mehmet Berk Åžahin 

This is a term project of EEE 485 - Statistical Learning and Data Analytics course, which is given in Bilkent University. Here are some useful material : 

1. You can find the report at Report.pdf. 
2. Source code is code.py. 
3. Dataset is compressed in data.zip. 

I suggest you to first read the report, then download the dataset and code and play with it. I hope this is useful for you. Enjoy!
